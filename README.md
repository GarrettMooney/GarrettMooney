ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning :

- C, Rust, Go, and Assembly for learning a bit more about Linux & systems programming
- Enough JS/TS, HTML, CSS to at least prototype my own apps...I'm liking htmx, alpine, and svelte
- A bunch of devops, security, networking and LLM stuff for $DAYJOB

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on :

- PPLs
- Developer tools (mostly in the DS/ML/LLM/stats domain)
- Learning (systems meetup? CMU DB course?)
